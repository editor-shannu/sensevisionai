***SENSE VISION AI - ACCESSIBLE LEARNING TOOL***

>>>Pain points & core understanding:

   Problem addressed: Printed/digital text is inaccessible to many visually impaired learners; they need reliable, fast conversion of text â†’ natural speech (documents, labels, screenshots,     web pages).

Root causes: Limited assistive tools locally, inconsistent OCR/TTS quality for regional languages, poor UI/UX for non-tech users, connectivity/privacy limits.

Primary stakeholders: Blind/low-vision students, teachers, schools, local NGOs, caregivers.

Current inefficiencies: Existing solutions can be fragmented (OCR apps separate from TTS), often English-first, some require internet or have poor layout handling (tables, math, mixed-language text).


>>>Solution:
An AI-first companion app that helps visually impaired students learn independently by converting study materials (text, images, diagrams, notes) into speech, while offering hands-free -interaction and emotionally adaptive narration.
-Multilingual support (English, Hindi, Telugu).
-Automatic hands-free use.
-Accessibility-first design (WCAG standards).
-Affordable, scalable for schools, NGOs, libraries.
-Empowers independent learning for visually impaired students.


>>>Future Scope: AI Personal Detection:

-Detect only one person in front of the camera.
-Read lip movements accurately to sync speech.
-Recognize hand gestures for commands or interaction.
-Adjust voice and responses based on emotions.
-Support Hindi, Telugu, and English languages.
-Learn user preferences over time.
-Keep tracking private and secure.
-Work with wearable devices like smart glasses.
-Adapt reading speed and tone for better learning experience.
